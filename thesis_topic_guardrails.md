# Thesis Topic: Robust Guardrail Systems for High-Stakes Government AI Applications

## Overview

**Duration**: 20 weeks  
**Field**: AI Safety, Government Technology, Natural Language Processing  
**Technical Focus**: Adversarial Robustness, Content Filtering, Document Adherence Systems

## Problem Statement

Government agencies increasingly deploy AI chatbots for public services, but these systems face unique challenges that commercial chatbots don't encounter. A voting commission chatbot, for example, must handle intense adversarial pressure from users attempting to manipulate it into making partisan statements, spreading misinformation, or deviating from official policy documents. Unlike commercial systems that can afford occasional mistakes, government AI systems operating in politically sensitive domains require absolute reliability and strict adherence to official sources.

### Real-World Challenges
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Users deliberately trying to trick the AI into partisan statements
- **Jailbreaking Attempts**: Sophisticated prompt injection attacks to bypass safety measures
- **Information Accuracy**: Must stick strictly to official documents without hallucination
- **Political Neutrality**: Cannot show any bias toward candidates, parties, or political positions
- **Public Scrutiny**: Every response is potentially subject to media analysis and political criticism

## Research Objective

Design and implement a comprehensive guardrail system for a voting commission AI chatbot that can withstand sophisticated adversarial attacks while maintaining strict adherence to official documents and absolute political neutrality. The system must be robust enough to handle thousands of interactions daily during election periods when adversarial pressure is highest.

## Technical Challenges

1. **Adversarial Robustness**: Detecting and preventing sophisticated manipulation attempts
2. **Document Adherence**: Ensuring responses stay strictly within provided official content
3. **Political Neutrality**: Preventing any language that could be interpreted as promotional
4. **Contextual Understanding**: Accurately interpreting official documents without adding interpretation
5. **Attack Detection**: Identifying and logging adversarial attempts for security analysis

## Guardrail Framework

### Multi-Layer Defense System
1. **Input Sanitization**: Pre-processing to detect adversarial prompts
2. **Query Classification**: Determining if questions are within scope of official documents
3. **Response Generation**: Strictly document-based answer creation
4. **Output Filtering**: Multi-stage content review before response delivery
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all interactions for accountability

### Key Guardrail Categories
- **Political Neutrality Enforcement**: No promotional language about candidates/parties
- **Source Adherence**: Responses must be traceable to specific document sections
- **Scope Limitation**: Only answering questions covered by official documents
- **Adversarial Detection**: Identifying manipulation attempts and prompt injection
- **Factual Accuracy**: Preventing hallucination and speculation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Threat Modeling and Architecture Design (Weeks 1-4)
**Activities:**
- Research adversarial attacks against government AI systems

**Threat Analysis:**
```python
# Example threat categories
threat_categories = {
    'prompt_injection': 'Attempts to override system instructions',
    'partisan_baiting': 'Questions designed to elicit biased responses',
    'misinformation_seeding': 'Attempts to get AI to spread false information',
    'scope_expansion': 'Trying to get responses beyond official documents',
    'authority_impersonation': 'Pretending to be election officials'

            'pretend you are',
            'role play as',
            'what would you say if'
        ]
    
    def detect_adversarial_input(self, user_input):
        # Pattern matching and ML-based detection
        pass

**Document Adherence System:**
```python
class DocumentAdherence:
    def __init__(self, official_documents):
        self.documents = official_documents
        self.approved_responses = self.create_response_templates()
    
    def generate_response(self, query, relevant_sections):
        # Generate response strictly from document content
        response = self.extract_relevant_content(relevant_sections)
        return self.ensure_neutrality(response)
    
    def validate_response(self, response, source_documents):
        # Verify every claim can be traced to official sources
        pass
```

        # Multi-stage filtering process
        checks = [
            self.check_political_neutrality,
            self.verify_document_adherence,
            self.validate_factual_accuracy,
            self.ensure_appropriate_scope
        ]
        
        for check in checks:
            if not check(generated_response):
                return self.generate_safe_fallback()
        
        return generated_response
